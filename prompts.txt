# Prompts Received

## Initial Prompt
Junie, generate a Quarkus sub project following the guidelines.

This quarkus project will need to be deployed to k8s, have a native build, support rest api endpoints and possibly need to interact with a fe via websockets.

Generate the basic foundation for this.

## Second Prompt
Ensure the resulting changes build.

## Third Prompt
Review the guidelines document and make sure the current projects align with those guidelines.

## Fourth Prompt
Confirm that the FE project builds correctly with the intended output for a react build

## Fifth Prompt
Given the FE build no longer need to be packaged with docker, please clean up the docker resources, update the readme and ensure that the github workflows build the project correctly.

## Sixth Prompt - this time to Warp 2.0
The todo.txt lists 3 items that need fixing. Can you review these issues and make the required changes to solve them?

## Seventh Prompt - to Warp 2.0
I've updated the todo.txt with additional items to address. Have a look at the file and implement the required updates. Also, update the prompts.txt with this prompt in order to keep a list of all prompts used for the project.

## Eighth Prompt - to Warp 2.0
Remember to update the prompts file to reflect this prompt. Change the deployment of the docker container from github to use aws Elastic container registry instead. Use OIDC for authentication. Use a secret defined in GitHub secrets called "AWS_ACCOUNT_ID" for the value of the AWS account to use. The role to use is in a GitHub secret called AWS_ROLE_ARN. Use af-south-1 as the aws region to deploy to.

## Ninth Prompt - to Warp 2.0
Update the backend readme file to reflect the change to aws ecr and OIDC. (And update the prompts file with this prompt)

## Tenth Prompt
For the backend quarkus project, I'm going to be using cucumber for BDD.

Prepare the project for the use of Cucumber with Gherkin by adding the quarkus cucumber extension.

Create the recommended folder structure for gherkin files and create a sample gherkin file.

## Eleventh Prompt
The project uses checkstyle. Validate that the checkstyle rules pass and make updates if they don't.

## Twelfth Prompt
Using the cucumber feature file in the backend project, implement the cucumber step file and the rest API's to support the cucumber tests

Ensure that tests execute and pass.

## Thirteenth Prompt
Quarkus is not starting for the Cucumber tests.
Add the cucumber quarkus ext "io.quarkiverse.cucumber.quarkus-cucumber" and then use the CucumberQuarkusTest "test" to bootstrap cucumber in the project.

## Fourteenth Prompt
I'm having trouble using cucumber with Quarkus and the cucumber ext for Quarkus. It looks like my quarkus server is not starting so my calls to the rest endpoints fail. What could be the issue?

## Fifteenth Prompt
Fix the linting issues on the backend build

## Sixteenth Prompt (Warp)
2025-07-03 - Please follow the guidelines in .junie/guidelines.md for this task. The current implementation of the BE is based on the features defined in the feature file test/java/resource/features/add_a_robot.feature. The cucumber tests work, however, the implementation does not distinquise between a battle id (of the entire battle) and the id of a robot. Each robot should be provided it's own id for the battle and send that back on each request to the server. Update the feature file to make this more explicit, then update the tests and implementation to work with a battle id (for the battle) and a robot id for each robot.

## Seventeenth Prompt
I've updated the add_a_robot.feature file. It doesn't change the behavior of the solution, but does improve the language of the feature file. Apply the changes to the tests.

## Eighteenth Prompt
For some reason, junie (you) is not following the guidlines defined in the .junie/guidelines.md file, specifically the one related to updating the prompts.txt with the prompts received.

How can I improve the guidelines to make it clearer and easier for junie to use.

## Nineteenth Prompt
Review the .junie/guidelines.md file.

Determine how to improve the structure of the guidelines to make them more meaningfull as guidelines to junie AI.

## Twentieth Prompt
On the last request, junie did not update the prompts file. This is a requirement of the .junie/guidelines.md. Are the guidelines not being applied and if so, why is that?

## Twenty-first Prompt
Fix the checkstyle errors in the RobotSteps.java file. Rember to follow the guidelines in the .junie/guidelines.md file

## Twenty-second Prompt
When you updated the RobotSteps file, you broke the cucumber test. it no longer matches the gherkin file for the When "I register my Robot supplying it's name"

## Twenty-third Prompt
Create new feature file in backend project that deals with creating a battle.

The following scenarios should be described in the feature file in the best practices for cucumber and gherkin.

The features are realised by API calls onto the backend. 

The arena is a map of blocks x * y in dimensions. It represents the playing field or board that robots will navgate during the battle.

A user creates a new Battle by supplying the battle name, but without specifying a battle arena size. The server generates an arena with the size specified in the properties configuration of the server.
The server returns the battleId for this new battle, along with details of the arena size and name and id. 

A user creates a new Battle by supplying the battle name and the dimensions for the battle arena. It should be no smaller than 10 * 10 and no larger than 1000 * 1000.  The server returns the battleId for this new battle, along with details of the arena size and name and id. 

Adjust the existing code that implements the existing features to align with the above without breaking the existing features and related tests. 

Remember to follow the .junie/guidelines.md file off of the the rool folder.

## Twenty-fourth Prompt
You didn't update the prompts.txt file with the previous prompt. Please do so now.

## Twenty-fifth Prompt
Given the following issue description `<issue_description>`, could you help me in implementing the necessary changes to the repository to meet the specified requirements?
<issue_description>
## 
Review the updated .junie/guidelines.md file section 7. Apply the process required.
</issue_description>

## Twenty-sixth Prompt
Given the following issue description `<issue_description>`, could you help me in implementing the necessary changes to the repository to meet the specified requirements?
<issue_description>
## 
Update the add_a_robot.feature feature file to ensure that adding a robot does not create a battle, but requires that one has already been created. That is, using the features in the create_a_battle.feature file, a battle would have been created. Only then can a user add a robot to the battle. 

Follow the process for prompts in section 7 of the .junie/guidelines.md file.

## Twenty-seventh Prompt
Given the following issue description `<issue_description>`, could you help me in implementing the necessary changes to the repository to meet the specified requirements?
<issue_description>
## 
Add a new feature file for the backend project following the cucumber and gherkin best practices. The new feature set must support the following features.

Allow a user to move the robot by specifying the id of the robot, the direction of the robot (North, south, east, west or nw, ne, sw, se) and how many blocks to move. Each block represents on block on the arena map.

The instruction to the server to move the robot will start the move process. Each second (as the default from the configuration file), the robot can move one space in the requested direction. The position of the robot in the battle arena should be reflected based on this movement. The movement starts from the robots current position and replaces any other movements instructions that may still be running. 

If the robot attempts to move past the last block of the arena, then it stops moving at that point and it's location is the last valid point. The status of the robot should then indicated "crashed".

While the robot is moving, it's state should indicate "moving".

Follow the guidelines in the .junie/guidelines.md file, specifically section 7 that defines what's required for each prompt.

## Twenty-eighth Prompt
The cucumber tests are not passing. Fix this.

## Twenty-ninth Prompt
Given the following issue description `<issue_description>`, could you help me in implementing the necessary changes to the repository to meet the specified requirements?
<issue_description>
## 
Following the .junie/guidelines.md file (spefically section 7) change the way you've validated the move_robots.feature features. You've create an API to position the robot at a specific spot "public Response updateRobotPosition(@PathParam("battleId")..." This is ont an API that should be available to users and as such please use a different mechanism to position the robot for the related tests. 
</issue_description>

## Thirtieth Prompt
Remember to update the prompts.txt file. The updateRobotPosition api is still available. This should have been removed as part of the last prompts outcome.

## Thirty-first Prompt
Update the prompts.txt file with the previous prompt

## Thirty-second Prompt
Given the following issue description `<issue_description>`, could you help me in implementing the necessary changes to the repository to meet the specified requirements?
<issue_description>
## 
Follow the guidelines in the .junie/guidelines.md file. 
Update the feature files for creating a battle to allow the user to specify how much time it takes the robot to move a block. Load the default value of 1 second from the property file. Use a value of .5 seconds for all the test scenarios.

update the feature file to reflect the above requirement. Update the tests to use the new .5 second value, update thie implementation to support the supplied value or fallback to the value from the configuration. 

Update the prompts and run a root level build as per the guidelines to ensure everything still works.
