# Frontend Environment Variables

# Backend URL configuration
# This is used during the build process to generate the config.js file
# In development, this defaults to http://localhost:8080
# In production, this is set via GitHub repository variables
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Example for production deployment where backend is on different host
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://api.robotwars.com

# Example for different port on same host
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:9080

# Note: For production deployments to S3, the backend URL is configured
# via GitHub repository variables (BACKEND_URL) and gets baked into the
# static build during the CI/CD process.
