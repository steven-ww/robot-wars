Given the user navigates to the arena page for a battle
    AND a battle is in progress,
    THEN show a window on the right of the arena that shows, for each action taken, the name of the robot and the action taken (eg radar, move)
    AND allow this text to scroll up and out of the box as the battle continues.

Given the user navigates to the arena page for a battle,
    when the page is rendered, have it fit into the browser widow (desktop only) such that the user can see the entire arena without scrolling
    AND the text window of actions taken by the robots is visible on the right of the window
    AND this works across 20*20, 50*50 and 100*100 arena sizes
